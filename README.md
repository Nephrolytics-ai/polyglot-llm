# polyglot-llm
# Purpose
This is an open source LLM wrapper library in Go. 
It provides a common interface for interacting with different LLM providers, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, and Azure. The goal is to make it easy to switch between different LLM providers without having to change your code.

This software is provide open from Nephrolytics and is intended to be used by anyone who wants to use LLMs in their projects. We welcome contributions and feedback from the community.

Nephrolytics does NOT provide support on this library, but we will do our best to review and merge pull requests in a timely manner and answer questions as we can.


There is a a library call LangchainGo.  The library is old and not being actively maintained, and it also has a little different design philosophy than what we want to achieve with this library.
But its a good reference for how to implement the LLM interface and the generator interface, as well as how to handle tools and logging.
